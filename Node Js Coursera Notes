Node Js Coursera Notes

What is Node.js?
	- Javascript runtime built on Chrome V8 Javascript Engine
	- Uses an event driven, non-blocking I/O Model
		: makes it lightweight and efficient
	*Important: Node runs as a single threaded application, but is able to service a lot of requests
	*Uses asychronous programming

Node js Use Cases
	- Utilities written in Javascript for web development:
		: Bower, Grunt, Gulp, Yeoman, etc...
	- Server side development
		: Web server, Business logic, Database access

Node Package Manager
	- Node package manager(NPM): manages ecosystem of node modules/packages
	- A package contains:
		*JS files
		* package.json (manifest)
			- explains what this node module contains and also other dependecies are expressed here

Javascript Modules
	- Javascript does not define a standard library
	- Common Js API fills this gap by defining APIs for common application needs
		* It defines a module format
		* Node follows the CommonJs module specification

Node Modules
	- Each file in Node is its own module
	- The predefined 'module' variable gives access to the current module definition in a file
	- The 'module.exports' variable determines the export from the current module
	- The 'require' function is used to import a module
	Important!: Module.exports is just a variable and you can assign anything to it, just like any other variable

	A better alternative!
		'exports' is an alias for 'module.exports', so you define multiple parts, such as:
		 exports.perimeter = function(x,y){} OR
		 exports.area = function(x,y){};


Two Salient Features of Javascript
	- First Class Functions: A function can be treated the same way as any other variable
	- Closures:
		* A function defined inside another function has access to all the variables declared in the outer function(outer scope)
		* The inner function will continue to have access to the variables from the outer scope even after the outer function
		has returned.

I/O = Long Running Computation


Node Modules
	- File Based Node Modules(files we make)
	- Core Modules
		* Part of core Node
		* Examples: path, fs, os, util...
	- External Node modules
		* Third party modules
		* Installed using NPM
		* node_modules folder in your Node application


HTTP Protocol

Client and Server
	- Web applications are not stand alone
	- Many of them have a 'cloud' backend

Client Server Communcation
	- Network operations cause unexpected delays
	- You need to write all applications recognizing the asychronous nature of communication
		* Data is not instantly available

The client usually sends a request message to the server. The server will then usually contain a method, get, put, etc...



Node HTTP Module
	- Core networking module supporting a high performance foundation for a HTTP stack
	- Using the module:
		var http = require('http');
	- Creating a server:
		var server = http.createServer(function(req,res){...});
		req = request, res = response
	- Starting the server:
		server.listen(port,...);
	- req.headers gives access to all the headers in the request message in the form of a javascript object
	- same thing with req.body
	- examples with res:
		res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
		res.statusCode = 200;
		res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type' : 'text/html'});
		res.write('Hello World');
		res.end('<html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>');


Express Notes!!!!

What is Express
	- Express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js (from expressjs.com)
	- Web application framework that provides a robust set of features
	- Many third party middleware to extend functionality
	- Installing Express: in your project folder do: npm install express --save

Express Middleware
	- Middleware provides a lot of plug in functionality that can be used within your Express application
	- Example: 'morgan' for logging
		var morgan = require('morgan');
		app.use(morgan('dev'));
	- Serving static web resources:
		app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
		__filename and __dirname give you the full path to the file and directory for the current module



Representational State Transfer (REST)

Web Services
	- A system designed to support interoperability of systems connected over a network
		Service oriented architecture (SOA)
		A standardized way of integrating web based applications using open standards operating over the Internet
	- Two common approaches used in practice
		SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) based services
			* Uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
			* XML Based
		REST(Representational State Transfer)
			* Use Web standards
			* Exchange of data using either XML or JSON
			* Simpler compared to SOAP, WSDL, etc...

Representational State Transfer(REST)
	- A style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web
	- A collection of network architecture principles which outline how resources are defined and addressed
	- Four Basic Design Principles:
		* Use HTTP methods explicitly
		* Be stateless
		* Expose directory structure-like URIs
		* Transfer using XML, JSON, or both
	- The motivation for REST was to capture the characteristics of the Web that made the Web succesful
		* URI (Uniform Resource Indicator) Addressable resources
		* HTTP Protocol
		* Make a Request - Receive Response - Display Response
	- Exploits the use of the HTTP protocol beyond HTTP POST and HTTP GET
		* HTTP PUT, HTTP DELETE
		* Preserve idempotence (eye - dem - po - tense), figuring out with requests preserve the state or not
	- REST uses URI to identify resources(anything that can be named, type of file, etc...)
		* http://www.conFusion.food/dishes/
		* http://www.conFusion.food/promotions/
	- Verbs corresponding to the CRUD operations
		* Create: HTTP POST
		* Read : HTTP GET
		* Update : HTTP PUT
		* Delete : HTTP DELETE

Stateless Server
	- Server side should not track the client state:
		* Every request is a new request from the client
	- Client side should track its own state:
		* E.g., using cookies, client side database
		* Every request must include sufficient information for server to serve up the requested information
		* Client side MVC setup



Express Router

Express Application Rules
	- Identify and endpoint with a URI
	- Apply the verb on the URI
	- Express supports this through app.all, app.get, app.post, app.put, app.delete methods
	- Express allows us to apply functionality to different routes

Routes with Parameters
	- Example: 
	app.get('/dishes/:dishId', function(req, res, next){
		res.end('Will send details of the dish:' + req.params.dishId + ' to you!') 
	});
	- res.params is a javascript object that comes in, console log to learn more!

Body Parser
	- Middleware to parse the body of the message
	- Using Body Parser:
		var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
		app.use(bodyParser.json()); //parse the JSON in the body
	- Parses the body of the message and populates the req.body property, makes it available as a javascript object

Express Router
	- Express Router creates a mini-Express application:
		var dishRouter = express.Router();
		dishRouter.use(bodyParser.json())



Express Generator (Global npm module)

	- Quick scaffolding tool to generate an Express application skeleton
	- Installing express generator: npm install express-generator -g
	- Generating an Express Application:
		* express <App Name>
			- Generates a folder under the current folder with the name <App Name>
			- Various options available
		* The move to the folder and install the node modules: npm install



MONGO DB!!!!!!

Database
	- Databases are used to store structured information
	- Databases support various operations on the data:
		* Query
		* Insert
		* Update
		* Delete

NoSQL Databases
	- SQL (structured query language) based relational databases have been very popular means of storing data
	- NoSQL databases are increasingly becoming popular to address some challenges encountered with SQL databases
	- Four Broad Categories:
		* Document databases (MongoDb)
		* Key Value databases (Redis)
		* Column family databases (Cassandra)
		* Graph databases (Neo4J)

Document Databases
	- Document: a self contained piece of information, ex: JSON document
	- Collection: a collection of documents
	- Database: A set of collections

Whey NoSQL?
	- Scalability
		* Availability
		* Consistency
		* Partition tolerance
	- Ease of deployment
		* No object relation mapping required

MongoDB
	- Document Database
	- Server can support multiple databases
	- A database consists of a set of collections
	- A collection is a set of documents
	- Document is effectively a JSON document with some additional features

MongoDB Format
	- Mongo stores the documents in BSON (binary JSON) format
	- Supports the length prefix on each value, which makes it easy to skip over a field
	- Information about the type of a field value
	- Additional primitive types not supported by raw JSON like UTC date time, raw binary, and ObjectID

MongoDB ObjectID
	- Every document in Mongo must have an '_id' field that is unique
	- Default ObjectID created by Mongo when you insert a document:
		{
			'_id' : ObjectId('ijdfi4joij345353'),
			'name' : 'Uthapizza',
			'description' : 'test'
		}


SYNTAX:
	- use 'mongod' to start the server
	- then open a seperate command window, type 'mongo' to access envirmonment and key commands


Node MongoDB Driver
	- Provides a high level API for a Node application to interact with the MongoDB Server
	- Installation: npm install mongodb --save

MongoDB Driver
	- The Node MongoDB Driver supports several operations that can be performed from a Node application
		* Connecting to a MongoDB
		* Inserting, deleting, updating, and querying documents
	- Supports both callback based and promise based interactions


MongoDb
	- MongoDB stores data in the form of documents
	- No structure imposed on the document
		* any document can be stored in any collection
		* relies on developer's discipline to maintain the structure of the documents

Mongoose
	- Mongoose ODM
		* Object Data Model
		* Object Document Mapping
		* Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
	- Adds structure to MongoDB documents through schema

Mongoose Schema
	- Schema:
		* Structure of the data to be stored
		* Defines all the fields of your document and their types
			- Can do validation
	- Schema types: string, number, date, buffer, boolean, mixed, objectID, array
	- Schema is used to create a Model function


HTTP Basic Access Authenication
	- Method for HTTP user agent to provide username and password with a request
	- Server can challenge a client to authenticate itself
	- Client needs to send the username and password in response


Authorization Header
	- The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
		1. Username and password are combined into a string 'username.password'
		2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64
		3. The authorization method and a space, i.e, 'Basic' is then put before the encoded string
	- Example: Basic jiojdfoidjoifjdoifjaiojijfoi


HTTP is a stateless protocol, this means that every request coming in from a client is treated as a new request

HTTP Cookies
	- small piece of data sent from a web server and stored on the client side
	- each subsequent request from the client side should include the cookie in the request header

Express and Cookies
	- Server can set a cookie as follows in any of the middleware: res.cookie(name, value, options)
	- Cookies are parsed in Express server using the cookie-parser middleware
		* var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
		* app.use(cookieParser());
	- Cookie-parser parses incoming cookies and attches them to request
		* req.cookies.name

Express and Signed Cookies
	- Signed Cookie: signed with a secret key on the server side
		* Digital signature with key-hash message authenication code (verifiable)
	- Cookie parser supports signed cookies:
		* var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
		* app.use(cookieParser('secret key'));
	- Parsed signed cookies made available as: req.signedCookies.name

Express Sessions
	- Used to track user sessions
		* Combination of cookie with session id and server side storage of information indexed by session id
		* Session information:
			- stored by default in memory (wiped out when server restarts)
			- stored in permanent store on server side
			- distributed session store if using multiple replicated servers

Express Session Middleware
	- var session = require('express-session');
	- var FileStore = require('session-file-store')(session);
	- Express session information available as: req.session.name


Token Based Authentication
	- Cookie based authenication does not scale very well...

Cookie + Session Based Authentication
	- Cookies set on the client side by the server
	- Cookies used as a storage for session ID that is used as an index into server side storage of session information

Why Token Based Authentication?
	- Session authentication becomes a problem when we need stateless server and scalability
	- Mobile applications platforms have a hard time handling cookies/sessions
	- Sharing authentication with other applications not feasible
	- Cross origin sharing (CORS) problem
	- Cross site request forgery (CSRF)

Toked Based Authentication
	- User requests access with their username and password
	- Server validates credentials
	- Server creates a signed token and sends it to the client (nothing stored on the server)
	- All subsequent requests from the client should include the token
	- Server verifies the token and responds with data if validated

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
	- Self Contained (carry all the information necessary within itself)
	- Shareable (Can share it with other applications to act on your behalf)

jsonwebtoken Node Module
	- Implementation of JSON web tokens support
		* npm install jsonwebtoken --save
	- Provides several methods:	
		* sign() for signing and issuing token
		* verify() for verifying and decoding token and making it available on the request property in Express


Passport
	- authentication middleware for Node js
	- modular, flexible
	- supports variable strategies for authentication
		* local strategy
		* openID
		* Oauth (Facebook, Twitter, G+, etc.) single sign-on
	- Installing: npm install passport --save

Passport Example
	- app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local'), function(req, res){
		//if this function gets called, authentication was successful.
		//'req.user' contains the authenticated user

		res.redirect('/users' + req.user.username);
	})

Passport Local
	- passport strategy for authenticating a user with a username and password
	- installing: npm intall passport-local --save

Passport Local Mongoose
	- mongoose plugin to simplify building username and password login
	- installing: npm install passport-local-mongoose --save
	- makes variable Mongoose schema support for managing users
	- Example
		var mongoose = require('mongoose');
		Schema = mongoose.Schema,
		passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');

		var User = new Schema({});

		User.plugin(passportLocalMongoose);

		module.exports = mongoose.model('User', User);
	- End of Example
