Javascript Frameworks Notes

Software Library = collection of implementations of behavior with a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked.
This allows and emphasizes reuse of behavior

Software Framework = abstraction in which software provides generic functionality that can be selectively changed by additional user written code
Provides a universal, reusable environment for particular functionality as part of a larger software platform

Library vs Framework:

library - a collection of functions which are useful when writing web applications. Your code is in charge and it calls into the library when it sees fit. Ex: jQuery

frameworks - a particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in the details. The framework is in charge and it calls your when it needs something specific, app specific. Ex: durandal, ember, angular, backbone.
"Don't call us, we'll call you!" "The framework calls your functions only when it needs to" 

Imperative Programming Approach- you decide the steps to be done and you specify sequence. When you traditionally write code.

Declarative Programming Approach - Specifying what needs to be accomplished. You dont care how its accomplished. Transferring how its accomplished to the framework.

Angular js = declarative!!!

JavaScript Framework Terms:
	Single Page Application(Rich Internet Applications) - will go over later

	Modal View Controller(MVC) - will go over later

	"Scalability, Reusability, Maintainability" of Javascript Code - will go over later

	Test Driven development - testing is very important


Ember, Backbone, Angular JS Comparison:
	Backbone is the most flexible in terms of coding, then Angular, and finally Ember is the least.	
	In terms of easiest to learn: Backbone, Angular, then Ember
