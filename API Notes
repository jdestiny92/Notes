API Notes

Most API's in JSON format

Can mash many API's together

Example from omdbapi.com:

	?t=Frozen&y=&plot=short&r=json

	? starts it

	t = movie title to search for

	t=Frozen




Parse = taking a string and making it into an object



Two type of server requests GET and POST

GET - same thing as going to an url and making a request to get info to load a page



AJAX:

What is an API?
- offers a set of pre-defined routines, code snippets, and tools for building software applications
-A contract between one piece of software and another piece of software.
- APIs are often the bridge between different components
- not only receiving data, but also giving data
- data needs to be sent back and forth in the form of JSON

JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format used to correlate key with values
- in JSON you HAVE to use double quotes for both 'key' and 'value'

What jquery method do we use to retrieve data from a URL database?(Very Important!)
- $.ajax({url: queryURL, method: 'GET'}) - this saves the info
	.done(function(response){
		console.log(response);			 - this shows the info
	});

All API's are in apps, but apps are not API's!!!
Just the process of sending/retrieving data?


Sometimes you need to add an API key, and sign up for one!
