	if (confirm("Want to go to Disneyland?"))
	document.location.href="http://park.hongkongdisneyland.com";

	//Examples of numbers
	
	var number1 = 34.289;
	var number2 = 100;
	var BigNumber = 123e5; //12300000
	var SmallNumber = 123e-5; //.00123
	
	//Boolean vs String
	
	var Boolean = true; //true-false statement
	
	var String = "true"; //text statement 
	
	// parseInt() converts to integer
	// parsefloat() converts to float - number with a decimal place
	// String() converts to string or text
	
	
	//Console.log > Alert *depening on situation*
	
	//If you decalre a variable in a function, it can only be accessed in that function!
	
	// money = 99 is a local variable vs var money = 99 is a global variable
	// Javascript gives priority to the local variable in the function
	// If you declare a variable in a function that hasn't been declared before, it becomes a global variable
	// However, within a function: money = 99 is a global variable, but var money = 99 is not
	
	//Logical Operators for Booleans
	// Logical "And" - &&, runs true if both values are true, else it runs false
	// Logical "Or" - ||, runs false if both values are false, else it runs true
	// Logical "Not" - !, does opposite, so if originally true, it returns false, and vica versa
	
	//Arrays!
	// An array is a continuous of set of boxes starting from 0, then +1
	// var pets = ["Dog", "Cat", "Rabbit"];
	//    alert(pets.join(" and "));
	//    That results in Dog and Cat and Rabbit, it joined the elements within the array via " and "
	// However, if nothing is stated, "," is the default seperator, for example:
	//     alert(pets.join()); reads Dog,Cat,Rabbit
	// To retrieve from an array: alert([2]); yields Rabbit
	// To change whats in an array: pets[2] = "Hamster", so now its [Dog, Cat, Hamster]
	// To add to end of array: pets.push("Hamster"), so now its [Dog, Cat, Rabbit, Hamster]
	// To add to beginning of array: pets.unshift("Hamster") gives you [Hamster, Dog, Cat, Rabbit]
	// To remove an element from the end of array: pets.pop(); gives you [Dog, Cat] var animal = pets.pop() gives Rabbit
	// To remove an element from the front of array: pets.shift(); gives you [Cat, Rabbit]
	// To merge arrays: var pets = ["Dog", "Cat", "Rabbit"] var numbers = [2,3,4], then var result = pets.concat(numbers); [Dog, Cat, Rabbit, 2, 3, 4]
	// To generate random number: Math.random(); [0,1)
	// Math.floor() throws away the decimal place
	
	
	//Loops!!!
	//For Loops: loop through a block of code a number of times
	//For-In Loops: Loop through the properties of an object
	//While Loops: loop through a block of code while a specific condition is true
	//Do-While Loops: loop through a block of code while a certain condition is true
	
	//To Sort Array Alphabetically: Array.sort();
	// Array.reverse(); swaps order, does the opposite
	
	//If multiple same strings within array, use Array.indexOf(target, startPosition); to locate certain ones
	// To search backwards array: var pets=["Rabbit", "Dog", "Cat", "Rabbit", "Hamster"]; pets.lastIndexOf("Rabbit"); yields 3
	
	// SLICE
	//basically you take out a part or chunk including the parameters
	// var pets = ["Dog", "Cat", "Rabbit", "Hamster"]; pets.slice("Cat"); yields ["Cat", "Rabbit", "Hamster"];
	
	//Add Something To An Array
	// Array.splice(position,0,element) ex: pets.splice(2,0,"Rabbit") Yields [] but now pets is ["Dog", "Cat", "Rabbit", "Hamster"];
	
	//Replace Something Anywhere in An Array
	//For Dog, Cat, Hamster    pets.splice(1,1,"Rabbit","Fish") pets =  Dog, Rabbit, Fish, Hamster, yields cat
	
	//Mouse Events!!!!
	//onlick - when the user clicks on an object
	//onmousedown - when the user presses down on mouse but doesnt let go
	// onmouseup - when the user lets go of the mouse button
	// onmouseover - when mouse is moved over an object
	// onmouseout - mouse is moved away from an object
	
	//Look Up Timer Events!!!!
	//Loop Up Event Listeners!!!
	
	//Can Set Variables Equal to Functions, not loaded automically on webpage load, happens later!!!
	
	//Can Pass Functions and Return functions to each other!!!!
	
	//New Meta Tag: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content=1> refreshes the page after every 1 second!!!
	
	//Position absolute - Means our code will set the exact position of div
