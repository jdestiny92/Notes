GitHub Notes

Got to settings, then collaborators, then add collaborator

Can go to 'issues' then create new issue

If you're the collaborator:
	go to repo, clone the project onto your computer

	Click on issues

	Solve issue: 'create html page'
	In git bash: git checkout -b 'branchname'
	Then add, commit, git push origin 'branchname' instead of master

	Pull request = merging your branch into master branch

	Collaboraters can, though, just push to master, although its better practice
	to just work on your branch because there could be conflicts

	'git branch' shows all branches on your local machine
