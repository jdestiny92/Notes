4th Coursera Course Notes

Web content(Html, css, javascript) goes to either a browser or an App with WebView

Web applications for mobile can be developed in two ways:
	1. Fully client side application installed on the device
	2. Mobile web application developed using web standards and accessed through a web browser

We'll be doing the hybrid app developent approach!

Hybrid App Development Approaches:
	1. WebView App
	- The HTML, CSS, and Javascript code base runs in an internal browser (called WebView) that is 
	wrapped in a native app. Some native APIs are exposed to JavaScript through this wrapper
	- Examples: Cordova/Phonegap, Trigger.io

	2. Compiled hybrid app
	- The code is written in one language(such as #C or Javascript) and gets compiled to native code
	for each supported platform. The result is a native app for each platform, but less freedom during development.
	- Examples: Appcelerator Titanium, Xamarin, Embarcadero FireMonkey


Advantages of Hybrid Approach:
	- Developer can use existing web skills
	- One code base for multiple platforms
	- Reduced development time and cost
	- Easily design for various form factors (including tablets) using responsive web design
	- Access to some device and operating system features
	- Advanced offline capabilities
	- Increased visibility because the app can be distributed natively(via app stores) & to mobile browsers(via search engines)

Hybrid Apps Work Best:
	For content driven apps
		- Business and Productivity
		- Enterprise
		- Media


SDK = Software Development Kit
