Express Notes

Pay attention!!!

Server - code than handles requests and responds to them.

Servers live in dedicated hardware intended to handle ALL the requests and responses of many clients.
Servers can live most often on cloud platforms, ex: heroku

Express - web framework for node to make creating code for server much simpler

A route is like a map...
	* /join = user is shown the 'join' page
	* /add = user is shown the 'add' page
	* /search/:name = user is shown the 'search' page with just the results relevant to the name

Body parser formats your post data in nice objects

Look up route 'wildcard'


_ _ dirname = keyword in node, gives current directory name

the path native module simply puts string or paths together
