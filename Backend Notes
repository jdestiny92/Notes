Backend Notes

Examples of backend code:
	- api that parse URL parameters to provide selective JSONs
	- firebase methods that provide a timestamp back to users
	- clicking an invoice that provides a pdf report
	- image processesing software that takes an image applies a filter, then saves the new version

What is a server?
	- A web server takes a client request and gives something back. (Request & Response)
	- Server could be software or hardware


Intro to Node Js!
	- Node js is an open source, cross platform javascript runtime environment designed to be run outside of browsers
	- It is a general utility that can be used for a variety of purposes including asset compilation, scripting,
	  monitoring, and most notably as the basis for web servers
	- Can be used to make applications as well

Why Use NodeJS as a Server?
	- It re-uses Javascript = meaning a front end javascript developer can also build an entire server themselves
	- Its easily extendable = numerous plugins exist to expand the capabilities of node
	- Fast Implementation = which allows for the creation of an entire working server with only a few lines of code
	- Single Threaded Asycncronous Model = meaning the server handles all requests using a single thread through event based	  callbacks. No limit on requests. No bottleneck.
