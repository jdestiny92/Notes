Networking Essentials

HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that allows you to do client-server communication

REST API = Representational Transfer API

URL = Uniform Resource Locator

JSON = Javascript Object Notation

XML = Extended Markup Language

SOAP = used on top of HTTP for extra protocol communication

Network operations cause unexpected delays

You need to write applications recognizing the asynchronous nature of communication
- Data is not instantaneously available

HTTP:
	Allows retrieving interlinked text documents(hypertext)
	- World Wide Web

	GET = requesting for a particular resource to be delivered via the server

	If the resource we request is on the web server, an HTTP response message will be sent containing a message
	It shows a Code, ex: 200,201,etc... which corresponds to a meaning, ex: OK, Created....


	XML = eXtensible Markup Language
