Code School Angular Notes

A Directive is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some Javascript code.


Modules:
	- Where we write pieces of our Angular application
	- Makes our code more maintainable, testable, and readable
	- We can say "this module depends on these two modules"
	- Set dependencies and also define


Example:
	var app = angular.module('store', []);

	store -> application name
	[] -> Dependencies and other libraries we might need


Expressions:
	Allow you to insert dynamic values into your HTML

	Example:
		<p>I am {{4 + 6}}</p> Renders as 'I am 10'



Controllers:
	are where we define our apps behavior by defining functions and values

	Example of an object:
		var gem = {
			name: 'Docahedron',
			price: 2.95, 
			description: '....'
		}
