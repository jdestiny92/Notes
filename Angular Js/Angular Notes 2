In app.js, we created a new module named 'myApp'. A module contains the different components of an AngularJS app.

In index.html we added <body ng-app="myApp">. The ng-app is called a directive. It tells AngularJS that the myApp 
module will live within the <body> element, termed the application's scope. In other words, we used the ng-app directive 
to define the application scope.

In MainController.js we created a new controller named MainController. A controller manages the app's data. Here we use 
the property title to store a string, and attach it to $scope.

Then, in index.html, we added <div class="main" ng-controller="MainController">. Like ng-app, ng-controller is a directive that defines the controller scope. This means that properties attached to $scope in MainController become available to use within <div class="main">.

Inside <div class="main"> we accessed $scope.title using {{ title }}. This is called an expression. Expressions are used to 
display values on the page. The value of title showed up when we viewed the app in the browser.

Both the controller MainController and the view "index.html" have access to $scope. This means we can use $scope to communicate between the controller and the view. 

Likewise, any new properties attached to $scope will become available to use in the view.

In the controller, you used an object to group together related data about a product. Then in the view, you used dot notation to display the values.

AngularJS gets the value of product.price.
It sends this number into the currency filter. The pipe symbol (|) takes the output on the left and "pipes" it to the right.
The filter outputs a formatted currency with the dollar sign and the correct decimal places.
In this way, filters help to separate the content in the controller from its presentation in the view.


Angular Filters:
	currency - Format a number to a currency format.
	date - Format a date to a specified format.
	filter - Select a subset of items from an array.
 	json - Format an object to a JSON string.
	limitTo - Limits an array/string, into a specified number of elements/characters.
	lowercase - Format a string to lower case.
	number - Format a number to a string.
	orderBy - Orders an array by an expression.
	uppercase - Format a string to upper case.

In the controller, we used products to store an array containing two objects. Then in the view, we added <div ng-repeat="product in products">. Like ng-app and ng-controller, the ng-repeat is a directive. It loops through an array and displays each element. Here, the ng-repeat repeats all the HTML inside <div class="col-md-6"> for each element in the products array. In this way, ng-repeat shows both products in the $scope.products array. Instead of writing the same HTML twice as before, we just use ng-repeat to generate the HTML twice.

The ng-src is a directive that sets the <img> element's src to a property in the controller.

Directives bind behavior to HTML elements. When the app runs, AngularJS walks through each HTML element looking for directives. When it finds one, AngularJS triggers that behavior (like attaching a scope or looping through an array).

Great! Each time you click on the number of likes, the number goes up. How does it work?
The ng-click is a directive. When <p class="likes"> is clicked, ng-click tells AngularJS to run the plusOne() function in the controller.
The plusOne() function gets the index of the product that was clicked, and then adds one to that product's likes property.
Notice that the plusOne() doesn't interact with the view at all; it just updates the controller. 
Any change made to the controller shows up in the view.

Outline So Far:
	1. A user visits the AngularJS app.
	2. The view presents the app's data through the use of expressions, filters, and directives. Directives bind new behavior to HTML elements.
	3. A user clicks an element in the view. If the element has a directive, AngularJS runs the function.
	4. The function in the controller updates the state of the data.
	5. The view automatically changes and displays the updated data. The page doesn't need to reload at any point.
