Angular Testing

Angular was built from the ground up to facilitate testing
- Modular implementation with controllers, filters, factories, services, and providers, etc...
- Dependency injection

Test Driven Development:
 	Write an automated test case defining the desired functionality
 	Write application code to pass the test
 	Refactor the code to meet code standards

 Unit Testing:
 	Testing individual units of code
 	- Restricted to verifying if the component's logic is implemented correctly

 	Isolating the unit under test from dependencies is important
 	- Dependency injection enables us to inject mock dependencies
 	- Clear seperation in Angular between the DOM and logic through the use of $scope

 Jasmine:
 	behavior driven development framework for javascript
 	- adopted to test Angular applications
 	- use 'describe' function to group our tests
 	- use 'it' function to define individual tests

 Karma:
 	javascript command line tool (Node Js application)
 	- spawns a web server to load your application's source code
 	- executes your tests in the browser

 Angular Mocks:
 	angular ngMock module provides mocking support for your tests
 	- inject and mock angular services within unit tests
 	- make asynchronous modules execute synchronously to make it easier to execute tasks
 	- $httpBackend lets us mock XHR requests in tests




 End to End Testing for Angular Applications:
 	Unit testing is great for testing the units in isolation
 	- Frequent repeated tests
 	- Fast
 	- Does not test the interaction among the units
 	- Small test coverage scope

 Need integration and end to end tests
 - covers large group of module interactions
 - Slow, so not repeated frequently


 Testing Strategies:
 	Unit Tests > Integration Tests(testing integrations among modules) > End to End Tests (tests everything including user interaction)

 	Protractor:
 		Node program that enables running of end to end tests
 		- runs tests against your application running in a browser and interacting with it like a real user

 		Uses WebDriver to control browsers to carry out the tests
 		- Selenium browser automation framework
 		- Can use Direct Connect to test with Chrome and Firefox

 		Uses Jasmine for expressing the test syntax
